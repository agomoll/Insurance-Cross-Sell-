# Insurance-Cross-Sell

The purpose of this project is to look for trends in insurance data that may lead to a more narrow target profile for cross selling other insurance products. The sample includes data for a group of people insured for vehicles who have been surveyed for interest in other insurance products, specifically health care insurance. 

The vehicle insurance data from Kaggle which was transfered over from Analytics Vidhya. Location data was sourced to give the sample some geography but its application was basically random. It also came from Kaggle. An id column was added to provide a primary key for joining the two datasources. A few cleaning steps were then added to clarify column names.
